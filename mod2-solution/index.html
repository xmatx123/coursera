  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><h2>section1</h2><p>THis is the first section, nothing special about this section though, it just got the number 1...deal with it</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><h2>section2</h2><p>This is the second section</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><h2>section3</h2><p>THis section is awesome and special. It is not only the last section. It is even as good as the two section before added up. THis is ridicolous.</p></div>
